# Splash Screen TV Navigation Improvements

## Overview

The splash screen (source selection screen) has been improved to provide better navigation on TV devices. The main issue was that users couldn't see all available sources because there was no scrolling capability on TV.

## ✅ **Problem Solved**

- **Before**: Couldn't see all sources on TV because there was no scrolling
- **After**: Full ScrollView support with proper TV navigation

## Improvements Made

### 1. **Enhanced TV Layout (`fragment_player_splash_tv.xml`)**
- **Added ScrollView**: Wrapped the source buttons in a ScrollView for vertical scrolling
- **Improved Focus Management**: Added `focusable="true"` and `focusableInTouchMode="true"` to all buttons
- **Larger Buttons**: Increased button height from 56dp to 64dp for better TV navigation
- **Better Spacing**: Increased margins and padding for improved visual separation
- **Larger Text**: Increased text size from 16sp to 18sp for better readability on TV

### 2. **Alternative Grid Layout (`fragment_player_splash_tv_grid.xml`)**
- **2-Column Grid**: Created an alternative layout that displays sources in a 2-column grid
- **More Sources Visible**: Shows 4 sources per row instead of 1, making better use of TV screen space
- **ScrollView Support**: Still includes ScrollView for cases with many sources
- **Consistent Styling**: Maintains the same visual design as the vertical layout

### 3. **Enhanced Fragment Logic (`PlayerSplashFragment.kt`)**
- **TV Navigation Setup**: Added `setupTVNavigation()` method for better focus management
- **Initial Focus**: Set initial focus to the back button for consistent TV navigation
- **Simplified Implementation**: Removed complex ScrollView handling since it's handled by the layout

### 4. **Mobile Layout Consistency (`fragment_player_splash.xml`)**
- **Added ScrollView**: Also wrapped mobile layout in ScrollView for consistency
- **Better Spacing**: Improved margins and padding for better visual hierarchy

### 5. **Background Image with Blur Effect**
- **Problem**: Splash screen had a plain black background
- **Solution**: Added dynamic background image with blur overlay for visual appeal
- **Implementation**:
  - Added `ImageView` for background image that loads movie poster or TV show banner
  - Created semi-transparent blur overlay (`bg_blur_overlay.xml`) for better text readability
  - Used Glide for efficient image loading with fallback images
  - Applied to both mobile and TV layouts for consistency

## How It Works

### **TV Navigation:**
1. **D-pad Navigation**: Use D-pad to navigate between source buttons
2. **Automatic Scrolling**: When you reach the bottom of visible sources, the ScrollView automatically scrolls
3. **Focus Management**: Each button is properly focusable for TV navigation
4. **Selection**: Press center/enter to select a source

### **Layout Options:**
- **Vertical Layout** (`fragment_player_splash_tv.xml`): Traditional vertical list with larger buttons
- **Grid Layout** (`fragment_player_splash_tv_grid.xml`): 2-column grid showing more sources at once

## Key Features

### **ScrollView Benefits:**
- ✅ **All Sources Accessible**: Can now scroll to see all available sources
- ✅ **Smooth Navigation**: D-pad navigation works seamlessly with scrolling
- ✅ **Visual Feedback**: Clear indication of scrollable content

### **TV-Optimized Design:**
- ✅ **Larger Touch Targets**: 64dp buttons for easier TV navigation
- ✅ **Better Typography**: 18sp text for improved readability
- ✅ **Proper Focus**: All elements are focusable for TV navigation
- ✅ **Consistent Spacing**: Better visual hierarchy and separation

### **Grid Layout Benefits:**
- ✅ **More Sources Visible**: Shows 4 sources per screen instead of 2-3
- ✅ **Better Screen Utilization**: Makes better use of TV screen real estate
- ✅ **Faster Navigation**: Less scrolling needed to see all sources

### **Background Image with Blur Effect**
- **Visual Appeal**: Dynamic background images make the splash screen more engaging
- **Better UX**: Scrolling support ensures all sources are accessible on TV
- **Consistency**: Same visual treatment across mobile and TV platforms
- **Performance**: Efficient image loading with Glide and proper fallbacks
- **Accessibility**: Maintained focus navigation while adding visual enhancements

## Usage

### **Current Implementation:**
The app will automatically use the appropriate layout based on the device type:
- **TV Devices**: Uses `fragment_player_splash_tv.xml` with ScrollView
- **Mobile Devices**: Uses `fragment_player_splash.xml` with ScrollView

### **Alternative Grid Layout:**
To use the grid layout instead, you can modify the layout reference in the navigation or fragment to use `fragment_player_splash_tv_grid.xml`.
